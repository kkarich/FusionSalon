  I specialize in precision cutting with an artistic vision and impeccable attention to detail. I enjoy working with clients to come up with color and styles individualized to their personal needs.
  I have extensive color training with Redken Professional Hair Color. I enjoy keeping up and learning the latest trends in hair color, like Ombr√© and Bayalage. I try to work with clients to achieve natural hair color that helps bring out the details in their hair style.
  If you are interested in my services as a hair stylist please feel free to contact me via my email address and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
